Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.</br></br>Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.</br></br>Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. \\\"People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,\\\" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. \\\"The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.\\\"</br></br>The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings.\",\n          \"Stock prices climbed modestly despite a steep jump in unemployment claims. But the fresh evidence of economic malaise sparked a strong bond market rally. The dollar was mixed.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 12.43 to 3290.04 in moderate trading. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.15 to 412.08 and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.36 to 565.24.</br></br>Analysts said while the ups and downs of foreign markets have steered the U.S. stock market for much of this week, that influence may be waning as investors turn their attention back to the U.S. economy.</br></br>\\\"When you get up in the morning and hear on the news that Tokyo is down 2% or 4%, you can certainly get pretty depressed,\\\" said Joseph McAlinden, chief market strategist at Dillon Read. \\\"But the fact is that the Tokyo market has dropped from 39,000 to its current level over the past two years, while we're still near a record high.\\\"</br></br>Yesterday, stocks in Tokyo rebounded strongly while U.S. stocks rose only slightly. Initial claims for unemployment for the week ended July 11 shot up a startling 19,000 to 422,000, when many economists had expected a modest decline. \\\"The rise in unemployment claims was a little discouraging,\\\" Mr. McAlinden conceded. He noted, however, that some claim filings probably were carried over from the previous week, when many state offices closed in observance of the July 4 holiday.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"yes\",\n          \"no\",\n          \"not sure\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.</br></br>Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.</br></br>Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. \\\"People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,\\\" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. \\\"The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.\\\"</br></br>The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings.\",\n          \"Stock prices climbed modestly despite a steep jump in unemployment claims.

Initial claims for unemployment for the week ended July 11 shot up a startling 19,000 to 422,000, when many economists had expected a modest decline. \\\"The rise in unemployment claims was a little discouraging,\\\" Mr. McAlinden conceded.

Italians fear Fiat Industrial's stock-market relocation might mean it starts shifting actual operations out of Italy, too. The company firmly denies that--though its divergent results must make the idea tempting.</br></br>The valuation logic is clear. CNH trades at a significant discount to its U.S. peers like Caterpillar and Deere, reflecting its small, 12% free float. The Fiat Industrial group has been a victim of the Italian stock market's decline, which is trading more cheaply than other European bourses bar Greece and Austria. At 4.3 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Fiat Industrial trades at a 12%-33% discount to peers Volvo, MAN and Scania. A full U.S. listing should give it a valuation closer to U.S. multiples.</br></br>The merger should also lower Fiat Industrial's exposure to expensive Italian debt, potentially halving its annual [euro]400 million (about $495 million) net interest cost, Sanford C. Bernstein estimates. And if Fiat Industrial ever needs to raise new equity, that should be easier in New York's deeper-pocketed markets than in struggling Italy.</br></br>Still, this sensible restructuring shouldn't necessarily herald a broader move out of Italy for Fiat Industrial. That it has provoked such fears says much about Italian insecurity about the country's loss of competitiveness. In practice, Fiat Industrial would find it costly to move from Italy, where it has nearly a quarter of its plants and employees; in the last five years it has invested [euro]3 billion in the country.\",\n          \"For Syms, a Final Markdown; Discounter Will Liquidate Its Namesake Chain and Filene's Half a century ago, Sy Syms helped pioneer the sale of name-brand apparel and other goods at discount prices. Now, the company he founded is taking its own cue from his strategy: If you can't sell it, liquidate.</br></br>Syms Corp. and its subsidiary, Filene's Basement LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Wednesday. The retailer, which put itself up for sale in May but found no buyers, said it will sell its inventory and real estate and shut down, rather than try to stay in business.</br></br>The Secaucus, N.J., company, which has 2,500 employees and operates 46 stores under its Syms and Filene's Basement banners, said in its filing that the chains posted significant operating losses for the past two years as creditors toughened their payment terms, competitors proliferated and big apparel brands did a better job of managing their inventories. That left fewer overruns for Syms and other discounters to sell.</br></br>Syms, which was founded in 1959, compounded those pressures by snapping up Filene's Basement for more than $65 million in a bankruptcy-court auction two years ago, expecting to reap cost savings that never materialized. In its most recent quarter, which ended Aug. 27, Syms had a loss of $11.5 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $10.9 million.</br></br>Its decision to start winding up its business ahead of the crucial holiday sales season, and at a time when the sputtering economy has sent waves of new consumers to fellow discounters like TJX Cos. and Ross Stores Inc., underscores the company's precarious financial position.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Bond prices slumped about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. That was the third decline in a row, bringing the total drop to nearly two points.</br></br>Many analysts are expecting huge increases in the money supply over the next few weeks, partly because of federal income-tax refunds and partly because they expect faster economic growth. Bond traders fear that rapid money growth would intensify investor fears about the inflation outlook and would make the Federal Reserve much less willing to ease credit conditions.</br></br>Other Fed figures released yesterday contributed to confusion about Fed policy and the interest-rate outlook. \\\"People were looking for clear evidence that the Fed had made a decisive move toward an easier policy, but the data didn't provide that,\\\" said Rudolf Thunberg of Ried, Thunberg & Co., a New Canaan, Conn.-based investment research firm. \\\"The reserve data suggests that any move the Fed has made is a modest step indeed.\\\"</br></br>The federal funds rate, the rate on overnight loans of reserves between banks, ranged between 8.125% and 8.25% most of yesterday. That was up from an average of 7.69% in the week ended Wednesday, which was the lowest weekly average since mid-1978. Bond traders monitor the funds rate closely because it strongly influences many other interest rates, including those that dealers themselves pay to finance their securities holdings.\",\n          \"Stock prices climbed modestly despite a steep jump in unemployment claims.

Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.15 to 412.08 and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.36 to 565.24.</br></br>Analysts said while the ups and downs of foreign markets have steered the U.S. stock market for much of this week, that influence may be waning as investors turn their attention back to the U.S. economy.</br></br>\\\"When you get up in the morning and hear on the news that Tokyo is down 2% or 4%, you can certainly get pretty depressed,\\\" said Joseph McAlinden, chief market strategist at Dillon Read. \\\"But the fact is that the Tokyo market has dropped from 39,000 to its current level over the past two years, while we're still near a record high.\\\"</br></br>Yesterday, stocks in Tokyo rebounded strongly while U.S. stocks rose only slightly. Initial claims for unemployment for the week ended July 11 shot up a startling 19,000 to 422,000, when many economists had expected a modest decline. \\\"The rise in unemployment claims was a little discouraging,\\\" Mr. McAlinden conceded. He noted, however, that some claim filings probably were carried over from the previous week, when many state offices closed in observance of the July 4 holiday.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"relevance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.38228384967965817,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0,\n          1.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"combined_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7997,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SEC Chairman to Retire; Levitt Has Been Agency's Longest-Serving Chief Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. announced yesterday that he will step down by mid-February, ending the longest chairmanship in the agency's history.</br></br>Levitt, 69, has overseen the nation's securities markets during a period of remarkable change since President Clinton appointed him in 1993.</br></br>He told reporters that he had met with vice president-elect Dick Cheney at transition headquarters in McLean to tell him of his plans and that an acting chairman might be named before the new administration selects his replacement.</br></br>Levitt could have remained a member of the commission until June 2003.

Italians fear Fiat Industrial's stock-market relocation might mean it starts shifting actual operations out of Italy, too. The company firmly denies that--though its divergent results must make the idea tempting.</br></br>The valuation logic is clear. CNH trades at a significant discount to its U.S. peers like Caterpillar and Deere, reflecting its small, 12% free float. The Fiat Industrial group has been a victim of the Italian stock market's decline, which is trading more cheaply than other European bourses bar Greece and Austria. At 4.3 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Fiat Industrial trades at a 12%-33% discount to peers Volvo, MAN and Scania. A full U.S. listing should give it a valuation closer to U.S. multiples.</br></br>The merger should also lower Fiat Industrial's exposure to expensive Italian debt, potentially halving its annual [euro]400 million (about $495 million) net interest cost, Sanford C. Bernstein estimates. And if Fiat Industrial ever needs to raise new equity, that should be easier in New York's deeper-pocketed markets than in struggling Italy.</br></br>Still, this sensible restructuring shouldn't necessarily herald a broader move out of Italy for Fiat Industrial. That it has provoked such fears says much about Italian insecurity about the country's loss of competitiveness. In practice, Fiat Industrial would find it costly to move from Italy, where it has nearly a quarter of its plants and employees; in the last five years it has invested [euro]3 billion in the country.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
